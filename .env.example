# Number of workers in the pool and number of nodes to be used to run that pool
# IMPORTANT: For 23 × D48ds_v5 nodes (48 vCPU, 192GB RAM each):
#   - WORKER_REPLICAS = 40 (pod replicas for workers)
#   - NUM_WORKERS = 40 (model shards distributed across worker pods)
#   - Per worker: 22 vCPU / 90GB RAM (2 workers per node max)
#   - Each pod requests 22vCPU / 90GB, limits 24vCPU / 96GB

# The number of preprocess tasks running concurrently at each stage of the data pipeline. On average each,

# and output will be roughly the same size. Setting  a max concurrency to 2 will mean there will be no more than 2 read,
# 2 convert, and 2 write tasks running at once, helping to limit memory overall memory usage.
