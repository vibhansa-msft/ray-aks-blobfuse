# Ray Configuration
# Number of workers in the pool and number of nodes to be used to run that pool
# IMPORTANT: For 23 × D48ds_v5 nodes (48 vCPU, 192GB RAM each):
#   - WORKER_REPLICAS = 40 (pod replicas for workers)
#   - NUM_WORKERS = 40 (model shards distributed across worker pods)
#   - Per worker: 22 vCPU / 90GB RAM (2 workers per node max)
#   - Each pod requests 22vCPU / 90GB, limits 24vCPU / 96GB
WORKER_REPLICAS=40
NUM_WORKERS=40

# Mount Path Configuration
# These paths define where storage will be mounted in Ray containers
