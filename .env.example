# Ray Configuration
# Number of workers in the pool and number of nodes to be used to run that pool
# IMPORTANT: With 2-node cluster:
#   - WORKER_REPLICAS should be 2-3 (one per node + 1 for head node)
#   - NUM_WORKERS should be 4-6 (depends on available CPU/RAM per node)
#   - Default: 2 replicas Ã— 4 workers = 8 total workers (fits in 2 nodes)
WORKER_REPLICAS=4
